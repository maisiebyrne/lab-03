# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 1 below_

# There are a few issues with this data visualisation. Firstly, the proportion of the bars is incorrect toward the bars representing larger amounts of data, as well as the bar width of Chinese (this is also an incorrect name for the language of Mandarin) being different to the other bars, demonstrating poor scaling and labelling of variables. Furthermore, the order of magnitude for "Chinese" is different, being 1,026 billion speakers when it should be either 1.026 billion speakers or 1026 million speakers for consistency.



## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 2 below_

In image 2, the data is in the form of a pie chart when another form of visualisation would be better. Since the data is two numerical variables a line graph would make more sense to show the results. In addition to this, it is unclear what the height and wedge size represent as there is no key. 




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_Write your comments about image 3 below_
The graph is very unclear; there is no title on the graph describing what is being shown. The x-axis label ‘Rule of Law’ lacks specificity; There aren’t any values on the scale of the x or y axes which makes the graph hard to read, with the scale of the graph being such that the countries are very bunched together and difficult to interpret (no colour specifications, no country code specifications, the mean is also hard to identify).



## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_Write your comments about image 4 below_
#Grouping of ‘developed countries’ with no clarification of what countries that includes. Scale on X axis is uneven- $100-$200 takes up more space than $40,000 to $60,000- the logarithmic axis makes it hard to understand the data.



# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?
long data allows for multiple rows for each entity, and instead records new attributes or observations as a new row in the dataset and a wide format contains values that do not repeat in the first column

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?


This dataset is a wide dataset


How many observations are there in the data set?

There are 5 observations in the data set


## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c('1975', '1989', '1993', '1995', '1999', '2001', '2003', '2005', '2007', '2009', '2011'), 
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 3 here

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year,
                     y = percent,
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
geom_point()


```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 4 here



```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code
